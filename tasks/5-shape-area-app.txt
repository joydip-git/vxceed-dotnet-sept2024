create an application which calculates area of different shapes

Circle:
	attributes: radius
	functionality: calculates the area of the circle and returns the calculated area

Triangle:
	attributes: base, height
	functionality: calculates the area of the triangle and returns the calculated area

1. create classes for those two types in a separate library application
2. they must have necessary default and parameterized constructors, data members, properties and methods
3. in main method of an executable application, create objects of these two types
	a. print menu for user so that user can choose which type of shape object to be created
	b. based on the choice you create that type of object	
	d. calculate the area of the shape by calling the method and print the return value
