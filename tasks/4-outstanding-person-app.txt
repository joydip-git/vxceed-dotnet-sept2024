create a DotNet aplication to find out which people/person are/is outstanding


two types of person:

professor:
	attributes: name, department, number of books published
	functinality: returns true or false based on whether the professor is outstanding or not
	[logic: a professor is outstanding if the professor has published more than 5 books]

student:
	attributes: name, branch, marks
	functinality: returns true or false based on whether the student is outstanding or not
	[logic: a student is outstanding if the person has secured more than 85 marks]

A. Library
1. create classes for those two types in a separate library
2. they must have default and parameterized constructors, data members, properties and methods

B. executable application:
1. in main method create objects of these two types
	a. ask user how many person instances/records to be created
	b. create that many people (accept all the attribute values from user)
		i. print menu for user so that user can choose which type of object to be created
		ii. based on the choice you create that type of object
	c. save every instance in an array
	d. iterate through the array and figure out which person in outstanding and print the name and marks/number of books publshed for that person ONLY
